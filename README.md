# NPM Hate

## NPM is the most stupid package manager ever.
I thought the stupid landscape of C++ package manager (or lack there of) was bad, but NPM is even worse. Allowing for 
using semver in package.json is the most stupid thing ever. Only an idiot would think allowing freedom in versioning
is a good idea. It's not like NPM actually checks if the author broke any API or anything.

## I Shill for Rust
I've only encouted `cargo` issue once, and that was trying to compile to WASM, so it's not even something most user
would encounter. Why can't NPM be like Cargo? Why can't NPM be like Rust?
